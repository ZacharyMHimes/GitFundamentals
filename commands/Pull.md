# git pull

Similar to a [git push](./Push.md), a `git pull` will interact with a remote repository. Only this time it will **pull** the changes it does not have from the remote down to the local repository.
This can be done by adding the remote name and branch name:
```
git pull origin name
```

If there is any upstream connection estrablushed you can use the `git pull` without specifying a remote or branch.
